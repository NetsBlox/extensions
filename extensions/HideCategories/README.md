# Auto-Hide Categories Extension
This extension is designed to aid in automatically hiding categories for users. This is not necessary unless trying to hide different categories while collaborating; otherwise, categories can be hidden manually and will be saved in the project.

Currently, this just allows users to save IDE settings (ie, hidden categories) in a human-readable format in the project notes.

## To Do List
- [x] Make an extension that hides categories based on the contents of the project notes
- [ ] Add support for loading extensions with configs in the URL?
- [ ] Add support for configuring the extension via URL?
